          areas greatly effecting change and bridging the lives of Boholanos
          through the Sitio Electrification Projects (SEP) and Barangay Line
          Enhancement Program (BLEP), bringing light and improving lives of
          every household. BOHECO II is one part of the solution to address
          electrification challenges of the nation, and we have a crucial role
          to play. Providing energy access to all Boholanos is a key to
          development and poverty alleviation, it is a stepping-stone and a
          foundation to improving Boholanoâ€™s lives. We further believe that
          BOHECO II will surpass its present status to become a more progressive
          Electric Cooperative while being more and more resilient to future
          hurdles.
